## Alfie Bullmore

I am a full-stack developer and comfortable in both the back-end and front-end sides of programming. I am an enthusiastic, driven and analytical person. I want to work for a company that has a strong set of core values, with a group of like-minded people working towards a goal that I can get behind.

I have taken a roundabout route on my way to software development. Although I had always possessed an interest in the inner workings of a computer, along with an attachment to the mathematical side of education, I ended up pursuing history at university. Throughout my years at UCL however, I began to realise that what I truly wanted was a profession that satisfied my need for both a constantly changing and challenging work environment. I researched and then came to be enamoured with coding - a subject that had always intrigued me but, until recently, remained unexplored.  I therefore enrolled in Europe's leading development bootcamp: Makers Academy.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

During my second year summer of university I interned at October Films, a small TV production company based in Camden. During my time there I was able to integrate well with the team and help secure the funding for a new documentary on big data, due to be released next year.

The get the most out of the Maker's experience, it was imperative that you were able to work well in an team. In the first six weeks we paired with a different person everyday, while the final six saw us put into a different 5-person team each week. This gave me useful, real-world experience of working within a programming team that had tight deadlines to meet at the end of each week.

#### Fast learner

The 3 month, intensive nature of the Maker's experience ensures you graduate a fast learner. Whether it was learning the basics of Javascript in a week, or having to program a rock, paper, scissors [game](https://github.com/alfie-ab/rps-challenge) after only three weeks of coding experience, the whole experience allowed me to improve my ability in adapting to, embracing and learning new technologies.

#### Curious

We decided to build our final project in node, instead of rails. Node is not explicitly taught on the course, but I had learned it as a way to embrace the whole experience. Indeed, over my time at Maker's I made a special effort to look up and engage with programming libraries and frameworks, such as Paper JS, that were not required, but interest me regardless. As of now, I am independently learning React JS as a way to improve my front-end capabilities.
