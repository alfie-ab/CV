## Loope Fiasco

I am a full-stack developer and comfortable in both the back-end and front-end sides of programming. I am an enthusiastic, driven and analytical person. I want to work for a company that has a strong set of core values, with a group of like-minded people working towards a goal that I can get behind.

After finishing my History Degree at UCL I enrolled at Makers academy: Europe's leading coding bootcamp. At Makers I knew I had made the right decision to pick coding over academics. I loved process of coding, and the possibilities that it provided. The satisfaction of passing a tricky bit of code, learning how things that I use everyday actually worked and the ability to actively create projects, websites and programmes, all combined in the realisation that this was the career I wanted to pursue.

Since Makers I have been working in a full-time freelance role at a start up called Hippocampus. I came in right at the start and was heavily involved in choosing the technologies (React Native and Firebase) along with all subsequent technical decisions. It gave me great experience in mobile development, meeting deadlines and Agile development.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

During my second year summer of university I interned at October Films, a small TV production company based in Camden. During my time there I was able to integrate well with the team and help secure the funding for a new documentary on big data, due to be released next year.

The get the most out of the Maker's experience, it was imperative that you were able to work well in an team. In the first six weeks we paired with a different person everyday, while the final six saw us put into a different 5-person team each week. This gave me useful, real-world experience of working within a programming team that had tight deadlines to meet at the end of each week.

#### Fast learner

The 3 month, intensive nature of the Maker's experience ensures you graduate a fast learner. Whether it was learning the basics of Javascript in a week, or having to program a rock, paper, scissors [game](https://github.com/alfie-ab/rps-challenge) after only three weeks of coding experience, the whole experience allowed me to improve my ability in adapting to, embracing and learning new technologies.

#### Mobile development

From December up until April I developed an app called Hippocampus. The app, which works on both Android and iOS, aims to make doctors lives easier by creating an environment in which they can store, review and share their cases. It was my first experience of mobile development and I managed, with my partner, to get the app delivered within three months. The app was written in React-Native and has a Firebase back-end.
